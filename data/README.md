Each row of the output corresponds to an isogeny class.

This is description of the columns:
1. conductor
2. LMFDB class label if known, otherwise `NULL`
3. Trace hash
4. Modular invariants for the known curves in the isogeny class
5. Equations corresponding to such invariants in item 4.
6. The primes ell that we considered to test for isogenies
7. Modular invariants for all the curves in the isogeny class (this is a supset of item 4.)
8. Equations corresponding to such invariants in item 7. (up to isomormphism, this is a supset of item 5.)
9. A matrix representing the weighted isogeny graph that we walked, where where the weights are the square root of the isogeny degree

the input are the columns from 1 through 5.
